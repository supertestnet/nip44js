# Nip44js
An implementation of nip44 that runs in the browser

# What is this?
It's just the nip44 implementation from this project: https://www.npmjs.com/package/nostr-tools but I ran it through webpack to make it compatible with the browser

# How do I use it?
Visit this link: https://supertestnet.github.io/nip44js and open your browser console to see the magic. Copy the code to do it yourself.
